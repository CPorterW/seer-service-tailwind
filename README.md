# Freshman Discovery Project In Progress

I'm learning React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, while making an apologetics website for my church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
I became interested in apologetics after seeing Jacob Hansen make a splash on YouTube and finding all the other apologists out there. 
I was used to our church getting trampled and lied about in the media, so this inspired me to try and help set the records straight.

        <h1 className="on-white"> <br/> The Prophets Have Asked BYU Staff To Engage In Apologetics <br/></h1>
        <p className="on-white">
          Elder Jeffrey R Holland famously said in a <TextLink link="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/jeffrey-r-holland/the-second-half-second-century-brigham-young-university/" text="BYU Speech"></TextLink>,
        </p>
        
        <blockquote className="fancy-quote">
  "Elder Dallin H. Oaks ... quoted our colleague Elder Neal A. Maxwell, who had said:
          In a way [Church of Jesus Christ] scholars at BYU and elsewhere are a little bit like the builders of the temple in Nauvoo, who worked with a trowel in one hand 
          and a musket in the other. Today scholars building the temple of learning must also pause on occasion to defend the kingdom. I personally think this is one of the 
          reasons the Lord established and maintains this university. The dual role of builder and defender is unique and ongoing. I am grateful we have scholars today who 
          can handle, as it were, both trowels and muskets. <br/>
          To this, Elder Oaks then challengingly responded, “I would like to hear a little more musket fire from this temple of learning.” He said this in a way that could 
          have applied to a host of topics in various departments, but the one he specifically mentioned was the doctrine of the family and defending marriage as the union 
          of a man and a woman. Little did he know that while many would hear his appeal, especially the School of Family Life, which moved quickly and visibly to assist, 
          some others fired their muskets all right, but unfortunately they didn’t always aim at those hostile to the Church."</blockquote>
          <p>Remarkably, the quote from Oaks that Holland cites is from Oaks' 
            <TextLink link="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/dallin-h-oaks/challenges-mission-brigham-young-university/" text=" 2017 BYU speech, "></TextLink> 
            in which Oaks is quoting another BYU speech he gave, in which he

          <h1> Still, Apologetics is Less Important Than Showing Love </h1>
          <p>More recently, in the <TextLink link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/10/41holland?lang=eng" text="October 2025 general conference"></TextLink>, Elder Holland tempered this position.</p>
          <blockquote className="fancy-quote">"His disciples passing near a beggar, blind from birth. This led the disciples to ask Jesus several complex religious questions 
            regarding the origin and transmission of this man’s limitation. The Master responded by doing something very simple and very surprising. He spit into the dirt 
            and stirred a small mixture of clay. He then applied this to the eyes of the man, instructing him to wash in the pool of Siloam. All this the sightless man 
            obediently did and “came [forth] seeing,” the scripture says. How important evidence is, as opposed to wishes or argument or even malice in opposition to the truth.

            Well, afraid this miracle would again add to the threat Jesus already posed to their presumed authority, the enemies of the Savior confronted the newly sighted man 
            and said in anger, “We know [Jesus] is a sinner.” The man listened for a moment, then said, “Whether he be a sinner … , I know not: [but] one thing I [do] know, … 
            whereas I was blind, now I see.””</blockquote>

          <p>We need more people who know more about the ample evidence for our faith. However, we can't fall into the same traps as other apologists, who so often dismiss or
            misrepresent other people's arguments. If we choose to engage in apologetics, we must be Christlike examples, because, "By this shall all men know that ye are my 
            disciples, if ye have love one to another." Those who fail to approach conversations with love and understanding show that they are not Christ's disciples, and
            any genuine seeker after truth will reject their claims. This may mean turning the other cheek in some situations. Remember, some of the people you meet are stubborn like the
            Nephites that Mormon had trouble speaking to in <TextLink text="Moroni 9" link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p4#p4"></TextLink>. 
            <blockquote className="fancy-quote">"...when I speak the word of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they harden their hearts against it; 
              wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased striving with them."</blockquote>
            So most often in apologetics discussions, it's important to take the high road, if only so that those who watch your discussion will see.

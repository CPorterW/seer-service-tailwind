Pew 2024 - 87% of us believe that human evolution was the process by which we came to be, but only 8% believe God didn't play a role at all in that. Average American is 80%.

Gallup 2012 - We are happier and healthier than anyone else, and our well-being score ties for the top spot with Jews.
This survey controls for socioeconomic status, marital status, education, and child-bearing status. 
We'd score way better if it didn't, because we marry more, stay married more, and have more kids.
The Jews may be better educated, and they may make more money, but the Pew survey doesn't divide by gender in its education / income sections, 
or else we'd see high scores among our men, since our women stay home with the kids more often than not.
